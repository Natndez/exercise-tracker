# 🏋️ Exercise Classification from Wearable IMU Data

## Overview

This project explores whether wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) data can be used to:

- Classify barbell exercises  
- Distinguish movement intensity (e.g., heavy vs. medium sets)  
- Detect repetition patterns  

Using multi-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from multiple participants, I built a structured preprocessing pipeline, outlier handling process, and exploratory analysis workflow to prepare the data for machine learning modeling.

## Motivation

As someone deeply interested in both fitness and machine learning, I wanted to understand:

- How raw IMU signals represent barbell movement  
- Whether exercise patterns are visually separable  
- Whether movement intensity produces detectable signal differences  

The goal is to move from raw wearable sensor data to a trained classification and repetition-counting model.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:

- ~350 raw CSV files  
- Multi-participant recordings  
- Exercises including squat, bench press, overhead press, deadlift, and row  
- Intensity labels (e.g., heavy, medium)  
- Accelerometer sampled at **12.5 Hz**  
- Gyroscope sampled at **25 Hz**

Raw files are parsed directly to extract:

- Participant ID  
- Exercise label  
- Intensity category  
- Set identifier

The structure follows a modular ML workflow:

- Data ingestion  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Visualization  
- Reproducible environments

## Data Engineering Pipeline

The preprocessing workflow includes:

### 1. File Parsing

- Extract metadata directly from file naming conventions  
- Assign participant, label, category, and set  

### 2. Sensor Separation

- Load accelerometer and gyroscope files independently  
- Maintain set tracking  

### 3. Timestamp Handling

- Convert epoch (ms) to datetime index  
- Remove redundant time columns  

### 4. Multi-Frequency Alignment

- Merge accelerometer (12.5 Hz) and gyroscope (25 Hz) streams  
- Resample to **200ms intervals**  
- Aggregate using mean for numeric features  
- Preserve metadata using last observation  

### 5. Clean & Export

- Remove unnecessary columns  
- Normalize set type  
- Persist processed dataset for downstream modeling  

This pipeline transforms raw sensor logs into a structured time-series dataset suitable for feature extraction and machine learning.

## Outlier Detection

Raw IMU data contains significant noise and occasional extreme spikes that can negatively impact downstream modeling.

To address this, multiple outlier detection approaches were explored:

- Interquartile Range (IQR)  
- Chauvenet’s Criterion  
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)  

Each method was evaluated through visualization of time-series data with detected outliers.

Key observations:

- IQR tended to flag a large number of points, including natural variation  
- LOF captured multi-dimensional anomalies but was often overly sensitive  
- Chauvenet’s Criterion provided a balanced approach, identifying extreme deviations while preserving meaningful signal patterns  

Outlier removal was performed **per exercise label**, ensuring that movement-specific characteristics were preserved.

Instead of dropping data points, detected outliers were replaced with `NaN` values to maintain time-series continuity.

The cleaned dataset is exported for further feature engineering and modeling.

## Exploratory Analysis

Initial visualization shows meaningful signal differences even before modeling:

- Vertical acceleration patterns vary between exercise types  
- Heavy and medium squat sets produce distinguishable signal amplitude patterns  
- Participant-specific movement signatures are observable  

Multi-axis acceleration and angular velocity plots reveal consistent cyclical structure corresponding to repetitions.

These observations support the feasibility of supervised classification.
